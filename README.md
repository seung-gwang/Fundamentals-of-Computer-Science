# Fundamentals of Computer Science

Welcome to the Fundamentals of Computer Science repository! Here, I aim to provide a comprehensive overview of various essential topics in computer science. Below are the four main categories I'll cover:

1. [Database](#database)
2. [Computer Network](#computer-network)
3. [Operating System](#operating-system)
4. [Algorithm and Data Structure](#algorithm-and-data-structure)

Feel free to explore each section to enhance your understanding of these fundamental aspects of computer science.

## Database

In this section, I delve into the world of databases, covering concepts such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, database management systems, SQL queries, normalization, indexing, and more. Check out the detailed content in my Notion page: [Database Notion](#).

## Computer Network

Understanding computer networks is crucial in today's interconnected world. Here, I cover topics ranging from the basics of networking protocols to advanced concepts like TCP/IP, OSI model, routing algorithms, network security, and more. Dive deeper into the realm of computer networks through my Notion page: [Computer Network Notion](#).

## Operating System

The operating system is the backbone of any computing device. In this section, I explore various operating system concepts such as process management, memory management, file systems, scheduling algorithms, virtualization, and more. Expand your knowledge of operating systems with my Notion page: [Operating System Notion](#).

## Algorithm and Data Structure

Algorithms and data structures form the foundation of computer science. Here, I discuss different algorithmic paradigms, sorting and searching algorithms, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, hash tables, and more. Delve into the world of algorithms and data structures through my Notion page: [Algorithm and Data Structure Notion](#).
